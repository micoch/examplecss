# examplecss

This repo holds all of my own styles written with the stylus preproccessor. It serves as a quick reference of all of the basic styles that I wan tto include inside my personal projects.  The way I see it, if I resort to using frameworks to incorporate basic styling then I truly wont understand how style rules are implemented.
It will also eventually provide me with my own frame work that I will have complete understanding of and a way to only include the styles that I need to me it is a waste of rendering time as minute as it is to have a bunch of rules that are written but seldom used especially if all I do is overwrite them so I hope this provides a way for me to keep from bloating my code.

### [reset.styl](http://github.com/kizu/reset.styl)

I have incorporated kizu's reset.styl to easily incorporate resets.
