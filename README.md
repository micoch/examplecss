# examplecss

This repo holds all of my own styles written with the stylus preproccessor. It serves as a quick reference of all of the basic styles that I want to include inside my personal projects.  The way I see it, if I resort to using frameworks to incorporate basic styling then I truly wont understand how style rules are implemented.
It will also eventually provide me with my own "framework" that I will have complete understanding of and a way to only include the styles that I need to me it is a waste of rendering time as minute as it is to have a bunch of rules that are written but seldom used especially if all I do is overwrite them so in turn this provides a "framework" that I have written and fully understand while minimizing bloat. 

### [reset.styl](http://github.com/kizu/reset.styl)

I have incorporated kizu's reset.styl to easily incorporate resets.

### [responsive grids](http://adamkaplan.me/grid) by adam kaplan

As I dive into creating a grid system for my examplecss I came across a nice tutorial by adam kaplan that touches on the basics of incorporating your own simple grid system.  A nother resource I want to mention was by [the grid generator](http://www.responsivegridsystem.com/calculator) built by Graham Miller.
